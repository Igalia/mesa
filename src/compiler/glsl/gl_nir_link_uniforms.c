          *  members in the OpenGL API, which is:
          *
          *  * If a variable is a member of an interface block without an
          *    instance name, it is enumerated using just the variable name.
          *
          *  * If a variable is a member of an interface block with an
          *    instance name, it is enumerated as "BlockName.Member", where
          *    "BlockName" is the name of the interface block (not the
          *    instance name) and "Member" is the name of the variable.
          *
          * For example, in the following code:
          *
          * uniform Block1 {
          *   int member1;
          * };
          * uniform Block2 {
          *   int member2;
          * } instance2;
          * uniform Block3 {
          *  int member3;
          * } instance3[2];  // uses two separate buffer bindings
          *
          * the three uniforms (if active) are enumerated as "member1",
          * "Block2.member2", and "Block3.member3"."
          *
          * Note that in the last example, with an array of ubo, only one
          * uniform is generated. For that reason, while unrolling the
          * uniforms of a ubo, or the variables of a ssbo, we need to treat
          * arrays of instance as a single block.
