ACO TODOs

Features:
- implement subgroup operations
- implement other shader stages
- implement missing features for games or just CTS

Fixes:
- fix discard_if to check if anywhere(!) are lanes active:
	%tmp = active_lanes_at_start_of_program
	%tmp = %tmp & ~cond . EXEC &= %tmp. if %tmp == 0 endpgm
	- also schedule discard_if

Optimizations:
- optimize V_OR3_B32/V_AND_OR_B32/V_LSHL_ADD_U32/etc (VEGA)
- optimize sub-dword-addressing (SDWA) e.g. for unpack_*
- optimize boolean arithmetic
	- currently, we just pick the scc bit as dst.
	- if the scc bit is to be overwritten, it get's copied to a different sgpr.
	- instead, we could (sometimes) directly use the sgpr from the arithmetic instruction
- optimize iand(feq(a,a),fne(0,a)) and friends to v_cmp_class instructions
- lower to CSSA (done, but currently increases code size, wait for negative affinities/jump threading)
	- idea from the paper "Revisiting Out-of-SSA Translation for Correctness, CodeQuality, and Efficiency"
	- it is necessary to lower to CSSA for correctness wrt spilling (we don't have mem-to-mem moves)
	- also, it can enable much better jump threading by keeping empty blocks empty
- rework register coalescing to also use negative affinities (hard problem)
- jump threading
	- if a block is empty, not only remove the branch, but also change the exec mask handling in the surrounding blocks
	- a rework of how exec mask is handled might help (maybe with pseudo ops)
- GCM/LICM
	- long-term-goal is global code motion with register contraints
	- a good heuristic might do fine, but unrestricted GCM can do more harm than good
	- we might also want some kind of Sethi-Ulman sequencing to lower register usage even further
- Spilling/Rematerialization
	- currently, we only spill sgprs, and sometimes even const values
	- it might be beneficial to spill if it helps to squeeze in an additional wave (we can easily test different thresholds here)

Refactorings (lower priority):
- create an Instruction Builder class to be used for isel
- change schedule_postRA to be either a single forward insert_NOPs pass or really schedule to avoid NOPs (or both)
- nir_opt_sink() should either be merged with nir_opt_move_load_ubo() or be done by GCM


NIR TODOs
- pointer analysis / alias analysis
	- we really want to schedule independent memory operations
- memory coalescing
	- currently, we have tons of loads of single dwords
- ABI lowering for future hardware and maybe in very far future radeonSI
