# Unofficial GCN ISA reference errata

## v_sad_u32

The Vega ISA reference writes it's behaviour as:
```
D.u = abs(S0.i - S1.i) + S2.u.
```
This is incorrect. The actual behaviour is what is written in the GCN3 reference
guide:
```
ABS_DIFF (A,B) = (A>B) ? (A-B) : (B-A)
D.u = ABS_DIFF (S0.u,S1.u) + S2.u
```
The instruction doesn't subtract the S0 and S1 and use the absolute value (the
_signed_ distance), it uses the _unsigned_ distance between the operands. So
`v_sad_u32(-5, 0, 0)` would return `4294967291` (`-5` interpreted as unsigned),
not `5`.

## s_bfe_*

Both the Vega and GCN3 ISA references write that these instructions don't write
SCC. They do.
